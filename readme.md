## Introduction

This repository is my ongoing attempt to solve the first 100 problems of
ProjectEuler in C++. Any problems beyond #100 will not be uploaded publicly due
to [ProjectEuler forbidding it](https://projecteuler.net/about):

    However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not
    apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly
    aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly
    threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1
    to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if
    you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those
    problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.

Accordingly, for each problem I solve I try and explain in great detail the
mathematics and the computational consequences of each solution.

This involves detailed analyses of the generated code and proofs through
benchmarking.

It is important that one notes I am not a mathematician. I cannot fully
guarantee I am explaining the math with some "expected" form of rigor. Every
word of mine should be questioned. If there is a problem or something I can do
to better explain, please open an issue.
